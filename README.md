# MiniML

MiniML (pronounced "minimal") is a small ML-like programming language.
The current implementation is written in OCaml, and compiles to Lua.

The language and implementation are heavily inspired by the
lambda-calculus interpeter built in [Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/).
